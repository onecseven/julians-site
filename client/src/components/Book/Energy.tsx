    description="Reiki, prana, qi - tending to this inner life force vitality is a right and a resource
we all have but we’re not always taught the skills to work with our own energy
field. Strong emotions and merging with others’ and the collective energy can
pull us out of alignment with our own inner wisdom and soul purpose. In
these Guided Energy Work sessions, I hold space and offer guidance for you to
explore your subtle body, which may mean tending to places where you feel
stuck and finding the ways you can pave your path forward for your highest
good. Guided Energy Work sessions can offer an opportunity to heal trapped
emotions, anchor into your unique energetic signature to cultivate authentic
presence, shift Timelines, awaken intuition, and strengthen your connection
and sense of belonging to the Earth and the Universe. Each session is uniquely
crafted to fit your specific needs."
