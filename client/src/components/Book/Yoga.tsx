      description="Our bodies can be the site of so much joy and so much pain. Unfortunately,
the pain can sometimes knock us out of our bodies so we have a harder time
fully experiencing the joy. With Yoga for Embodiment and Transformation we
will co-create a space for exploring how to nurture the Nervous System and the
whole body, mind, and spirit. Gentle, trauma-conscious movements,
mindfulness practices, Vedic philosophy and psycho-somatic education offer
tools and resources to move through the dualities we expe rience in our bodies
so that we can feel a sense of wholeness with all that is. Feeling embodied and in
flow with life opens up the inherent wisdom we carry within us which can be
transformational. Each session is uniquely crafted to fit your specific needs."
