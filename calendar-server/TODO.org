* Julian's Calendar Server
** Objective: server that books appointments for Julian's website.
** Features we want:
** 1. express server
*** DONE 1a. GET endpoint that gets which days are NOT available
*** DONE 1b. POST endpoint that writes to DB when an appointment is booked
**** DONE 1c. Send notifications to julian (from the same endpoint).  
***** DONE 1c[1] Create a function that takes in data from the POST input and sends Julian an email with two links, one for confirm and one for deny. 
***** DONE 1c[2] Create endpoints that julian will be able to access to deny/confirm reservations
***** DONE 1c[3] Create a function that creates an email object for the user's reservation confirm, which will be triggered on confirm.
      confirmationEmail
***** DONE 1c[4] Create a function that creates an event and invites both Julian and the client, which will be triggered on confirm.
      bookAppointments
***** DONE 1c[4] Create a function that deletes an appointment from the DB, which will be triggered on decline of the reservation.
** 2. mongo database
*** DONE 2a. Figure out a way to represent appointments and time (timezones?).
**** name of the client
**** client email
**** type of meeting (check with julian)
**** date
**** time in unix time probably
** 3. Research topics:
*** 3a. DROP twilio
*** 3b. DONE google calendar API
*** 3c. DONE how to email?
*** 3d. TODO functions for timezone changing from unix time to others
*** 3e. TODO Figure out the flow of the app from the front end to the back end. ( or backwards I guess )
** 4. email
*** DONE 4a. Email configured and working
*** DONE 4b. Get reservation template from belb
*** DONE 4c. Figure out if it's possible to tie into google calendar API
*** TODO 4d. Figure out a good structure -- we probably want to output two different memoized
functions, one for reservation requests and one for julian's approval thing in particular.
