* Julian's Calendar Server
** Objective: server that books appointments for Julian's website.
** Features we want:
** 1. express server
*** DONE 1a. GET endpoint that gets which days are NOT available
*** DONE 1b. POST endpoint that writes to DB when an appointment is booked
*** TODO 1c. Send notifications to julian (immediately).
*** TODO 1d. Send notifications to the user (reminder, optional) via SMS or email.
*** TODO 1e. (research) Maybe link the whole DB to the google calendar.
** 2. mongo database
*** DONE 2a. Figure out a way to represent appointments and time (timezones?).
**** name of the client
**** client email
**** type of meeting (check with julian)
**** date
**** time in unix time probably
** 3. Research topics:
*** 3a. TODO twilio
*** 3b. TODO google calendar API
*** 3c. DONE how to email?
*** 3d. TODO functions for timezone changing from unix time to others
*** 3e. TODO Figure out the flow of the app from the front end to the back end. ( or backwards I guess )
** 4. email
*** DONE 4a. Email configured and working
*** TODO 4b. Get reservation template from belb
*** TODO 4c. Figure out if it's possible to tie into google calendar API
*** TODO 4d. Figure out a good structure -- we probably want to output two different memoized
functions, one for reservation requests and one for julian's approval thing in particular.
